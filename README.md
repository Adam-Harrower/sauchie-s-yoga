# Sauchie's Yoga Sessions

For my first Portfolio Project i have designed The Sauchie yoga session webpage 
Users searching the internet could find a local yoga club and see some of the techniques uesed in the classes, anyone from just starting out to someone that has been doing yoga for years can come along and join in. 

Someone using the wedsite can clearly see the types of yoga that is on offer from the class time tabel and the images in the community page and can sign up to come along to the classes that they like the look of.

## Typography and Colours 

- From Google Fonts I used Karla and Manrope
- For the site name and heading I used Karla, I liked the way the g in Yoga looked like someone sitting in the meditation position.
- For the text I used Manrope, I liked the way it looked with the Karla font.
- Colour I used #D2691E for the site name and headings as I felt i was soothing and relaxing to the eye, fitting for a Yoga page.
- For the text I used #808080, again it was easy on the eye and contrasted well with the site name and headings. 


## Testing 

- The website was tested on Google & Microsoft Edge

- The website is responsive on all standard screen sizes and functions correctly using the devtools device toolbar. 

- I confirmed that the navigation, header, meditation, the come along form and page contents are all readable.

- The form on the come along page works and can't be submitted until all feilds are filled out correctly, the phone number field will only eccept numbers and the email field will only accept email address with the @ symbol.

- I have confirmed that the submit button works.

## bugs 

- When the site was deployed for the first time, the menu on small screen sizes didnt work and would drop down onto two lines. 
- This was corrected by reducing the font-size and the letter-spacing. 
  - #menu {
    line-height: 20px;
    font-size: 8px;
    letter-spacing: 0.5px;
     }

## Validator Teasting 

- HTML 
- No errors were returned when usng the W3C HTML Validator.
- CSS 
- No errors were retunred when usning the W3C CSS Validator.
## Accessabilty
- The colors and fonts used are easy to read and work well with each other by using the lighthouse in devtools.
